# About this project
This project was created in the frame of the Applied Data Analysis (ADA) course at EPFL. The goal was to tell a story with a dataset. 

# Who are we?

<img src="/assets/img/oscar_ada3.png" align="left" width="100" height="100" hspace="10"/>  **Lena de Sepibus**, who was way too excited at the idea of telling a story - whatever if it's based on data

<img src="/assets/img/oscar_ada3.png" align="left" width="100" height="100" hspace="10"/>  **Olivia Ruggaber**, who was always there for help in the direst situation - and who made the nicest interactive plots of all
